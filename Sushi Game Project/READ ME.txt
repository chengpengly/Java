In this game, there are 20 positions on the belt, 5 customers sitting evenly spread out at different positions, and 4 opponent sushi chefs. Each chef is allowed to (but not required to) make and place one plate of sushi per rotation. Each chef starts with $100 in their account. When a plate of sushi is made a placed on the belt, the cost of the ingredients is subtracted from the chef's account balance. When the rotate button is pressed, any spoiled sushi is removed from the belt. Then each customer evaluates the plate in front of them (if any) and may or may not decide to consume that plate. If they do consume the plate, the chef who made the plate is credited with the price of the plate.

Each chef also keeps track of the total amount of food consumed by customers and the total amount of food spoiled on the belt.And one can select between showing the chefs in balance order (highest to lowest), food sold order (highest to lowest) or food spoiled order (lowest to highest).
